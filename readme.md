# How to compile and execute?
   There is a ***Makefile*** which automatically compiles and runs the project and tests:<br/>
     - ``` make all``` to compile the example application.<br/>
     - ``` make run name="exampleLevel.json"``` to run the example application<br/><br/>
     - ``` make tests``` to compile the tests using *GoogleTest*<br/>
     - ``` make run_tests``` to run the tests<br/><br/>
     - ``` make clean``` to clean the whole project from .o, .a, and exectuables<br/>
